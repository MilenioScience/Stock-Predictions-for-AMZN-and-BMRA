# Stock-Predictions-for-AMZN-and-BMRA
This repository contain two solution, stock predictions for AMZN and BMRA. We know that stock prediction is uncertain but what i am doing here is to try make predict future close value given the open and close value current day. First thing first i want to see how the data distribution is, it turns out is not normal distribution. So i came up with the solution where the algorithm must consider open value for N previous days, then i choose LSTM architecture. The result is pretty good to predict the value, the gap between the real and predicted value is near close. In fact, i try to calculate the MAE metrcis, and the value is 1.36 for amazon and 0.38 for BMRA.
